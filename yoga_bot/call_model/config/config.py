PROMPT = """You are a fabulous yoga teacher. Please generate a yoga class ensuring that the flow between poses is natural for humans and they do not get hurt. Make sure the generated yoga style is """

VINYASA_EXAMPLE = """I'm going to take 
you through a 20 minute flow something
that's gonna get you connected in your
head your heart and really put you deep
into your own body let's get started
so we're gonna get started seated and if
this is uncomfortable for your hips
you're welcome to sit yourself up on a
block or fold a blanket just so that the
hips are a little bit more elevated than
your knees you're gonna take your hands
just comfortably in your lap and close
your eyes gently and just sit up nice
and tall and all we're doing here is
just trying to find a deeper inhale
breath so as you breathe in feeling the
breath just gently pressing up into the
edges of your skin and as you exhale
just softening the shoulders away from
the ears feeling a grounded more earthy
sensation through your pelvis
I'm just feeling your belly gently
relaxed there's no holding there's no
crunching or tension in the body it's
just a gentle fluidity through your
breath you could imagine like a
fine-tooth comb just gently combing
through the inside of your body and
perhaps you'd like to set an intention
for your practice so just checking in
around why you've shown up on your mat
today what is it that you need be it on
a physical level mental level or an
emotional level and then we'll just take

the hands in front of the heart just
dipping chin into chest taking a deep
breath in filling your body up entirely
and exhaling completely

when you're ready just releasing your
hands lifting your head and opening your
eyes and we're gonna meet on hands and
knees so I'm gonna position yourself so
that your palms are directly underneath
your shoulders and the knees are
directly underneath your hips and you're
gonna tuck the toe so you get a good
stretch for the backs of the feet and on
your inhale breath you're just gonna tip
the belly button down and take your gaze
up as you exhale you're tucking the
tailbone deeply feeling a good squeeze
for the core in the back is around I'm
just going a couple more times at your
own pace inhaling to look up and
exhaling to round want to start defining
this marriage between your breath and
your body so the inhale is moving the
spine forward and up and then the exhale
is just pulling the spine from the back
body straight up towards the sky and you
can feel free to deviate from that
linear movement you can start to push
the hips in the head around just
involving the side body a little bit
more and then from here you're gonna
curl the tailbone send the hips back
back back until you find yourself into
your first child's pose so walking your
hands as far forward as you can just
dipping the forehead down towards the
mat so this is a really good way to
start to ground the energy am i taking
the forehead and the belly earthward if

it's too intense on the knees you're
welcome to place a blanket between your
hips and your heels you can also untuck
and sit back a little bit further and

then to add a little extra element we're
gonna walk the hands off the mat towards
the right so you're gonna ground this
left sit bone you know walk the left
hand a little bit further and feel the
left side of your body really open up
I'm just taking two breaths right here
so deep inhale into the left side in
full breath out and one more full breath

in get the body just gently rising and
then as you exhale feel a deeper
settling and then take it up come over

to the other side this time your right
hand reaches a little bit further I like
to come up onto spider two fingertips
and then kind of adjust I might tell the
shifts towards the right head relaxes
down towards the mat so feeling a side
stretch all the way from your right hip
through to your right armpit and then

slowly coming back up through Center
placing your hands back underneath the
shoulders tucking the toes for your
first downward-facing dog so you're
gonna lift the hips straight up and back
you're gonna walk the feet slightly back
behind you and the hands just slightly
forward and you want to feel the grip of
your hands on the mat like you were
palming a basketball so it's a really
really tight grip feeling index fingers
and thumbs pushing down and I'm gonna
bend the knees quite a bit and stick the
sit bones up nice and high when the neck
is nice and released and soft I'm here
you can create a little pedal here so
pressing one heel down I'm just
switching it out so down dog great to
open up the backs of the legs get to
stretch the spine tone the arms and
they're starting to get some good blood
flow into the brain from here just find

one more breath and steadiness so deep
inhale in full exhale we're gonna look

forward and slowly walk the feet all the
way up to the top of the mat you're
gonna bend both of your knees I'm gonna
take two fists and gonna slide them
between your feet and that's about the
distance you want your feet second toes
are facing forward so nice and parallel
bend your knees as much as you need so
that the lower back feels okay and then
just drop chin to chest fingertips to
the mat if you feel like you have a
little bit more opening in the backs of
the legs you can start to straighten the
legs just gently but the goal here
really is to release through the spine
so the deeper you bend the knees a more
sort of decongestant you're gonna feel
for the lower back we're gonna move into
a halfway lift so the hands can come to
shins or thighs I'm gonna create a nice
tall line with the spine as you gaze
forward and then as you exhale you're
gonna bow and forward fold and then
there's me anyhow you're gonna circle
the arms high above the head and come to
your first standing position taking your
gaze up
and as you exhale hands are gonna come
to center chest and again you're gonna
inhale circle the arms up as we exhale
hands are gonna come down through prayer
you're gonna forward fold soften the
knees engage the core lengthen into your
flat back gaze goes forward and exhale
bow and forward fold I'm gonna step back
into high plank so this is top of a
push-up position couple variations you
can take the knees down immediately if
you're feeling too much attention in the
lower back or the arms I'm gonna take a
breath in neck is long and exhale
bending the elbows close to your ribcage
and untuck the toes inhale you're gonna
take a cobra pose or just gently lifting
your chest up and off of the mat so this
is your low Cobra if you want to go a
little deeper you can push down into the
hands legs are strong gaze goes up and
then as we exhale you're coming all the
way back down you need to tuck the toes
come to your hands and to knees and
press straight back up downward facing
dog and it's just one simple breath in
and a full breath all the way out gazing
to your hands step or hop lightly to the
top of your mat come back into your
halfway lift and exhale breathe it out
inhale sweep your arms high above your
head and as you exhale offer your hands
to the center of your chest we're going
to take this flow two more times using
one breath per movement so inhale arms
come up exhale you fold down in how you

lengthen and exhale navel to spine chin
to chest fold inhale step back to your
high plank maybe this time the knees
stay up and off of the mat and as we
exhale shift forward bend the elbows and
lower to the mat tuck your toes Cobra
high or low and exhale tucking the toes
through hands and knees push to downward
facing dog
it's one breath to ground
exhale to release gaze forward step or
hop top of your mat flat back in fold

last round arms come up this time we're
gonna flow all the way through exhale
flat back exhale bow high plank pose

inhale this time you can lower halfway
chaturanga so the body hovers off the
mat I'm tucking the toes upward facing
dog or Cobra downward facing dog
exhale now I'm gonna hang out in
downward facing dog we're gonna start to
get into the hips a little bit more so
step your feet together to the big toes
touch on your inhale the right leg is
gonna sweep up keeping the hips nice and
square hands are settled into the mat
step forward all the way up to your
right thumb if your foot doesn't make it
use your hand to bring it through you
want to see that the right knee aligns
over your right ankle and drop your back
knee hands can come to your front thigh
gaze can be forward if you're feeling ok
here just stay here you can also roll
your mat to create a little extra
padding so that your back knee feels
safe and protected this feels good arms
reach out low lunge guys can come up
between the hands lengthening the

tailbone and lifting the chest up I'm
gonna as we exhale fingertips are gonna
come down to the mat and we're gonna
send the hips back untuck the back toes
and flex the right foot
so this is creating a big big opening
through the back of your right leg
if it's too intense bend the knee flex
your toes quite a bit here and see if
you can really square off the hips so if
you think of the energy and the lower
part of your body is being sent backward
and from your hips through the crown of
your head as being set forward let me
take a deep breath right here as you
exhale if you want to release a bit more
your chin can come into your chest and
you can release your upper body over
this leg
and then we'll look forward come back
into your lunge tuck your back toes
under and lift your back leg up nice and
strong so this is getting you through
this front left hip flexor and let's
look for just for a breath in and then
as we exhale plant the palms step back
to downward facing dog we'll step feet
together and we'll go to the left side
left leg lifts up try to keep the hips
nice and square on your exhalation step
left foot through to the left thumb drop
the back knee pad it if you need to
hands and come to front thigh or up
towards the ceiling so this would be a
really good flow to do post run or post
lots of sitting the hip flexors tend to
get quite crunchy so this is a really
nice way to really lean out and open up
for the front of this right hip flexor
and thigh you're looking to find a
little bit more balance I always reach
out guys get super still breath stays
moving inhale on your exhale to release
fingertips down and then send the hips
back for our hamstring stretch so toes
nice and active if you have a little bit
more flexibility feel free to walk this
left heel a little bit further forward
and I want you to imagine that you're
drawing your left hip back and your
right hip forward just to create a
little bit more length in the back of
this left leg you can stay here and
breather you can tip chin into chest
palms come flat find a little bit more
relaxation through your upper body and a
big breath in to where you're feeling
the most resistance in your body and as
you exhale try to soften around wherever
feeling that hold or that grip I'm

looking forward coming back into your
lunge tuck the back toes and lift up
your back knee sit the hips nice and low
gaze goes forward take a breath in and
as we exhale we send it back downward
facing dog pose we'll move through one
vinyasa so that's that flow of movement
high plank pose inhale exhale shift
forward and lower inhale your backbend
of choice Cobra upward facing dog exhale
downward facing dog push hips up and
back
gazing forward to your hands you're
gonna step our hop to the front of your
mat lengthen into a flat back as you
arrive and exhale we fold inhale we're
gonna stand all the way up and as we
exhale hands in and come straight into
heart center
and then releasing your hands we're
gonna take a balance and I'm gonna just
face you so you can see you shift the
weight into your left foot the sole of
the right foot is gonna come above or
below the knee it's important that this
foot is not glued right to the knee so
anywhere above or below I'm gonna take
the foot up into the crease of the groin
hands are going to come to the center of
the chest so you're focusing on left big
toe Mound
kind of like a thumbtack being pushed
into a corkboard that's your Center it's
kind of drawing you down into the mat
toes are relaxed hands come to heart
gaze get super steady you want to play
around with this arms and come up and
you can kind of play with your gaze and
look down forward or up towards the
ceiling to challenge the balance make
sure you're not holding the breath you
don't want to jeopardize the breath for
the sake of the posture hands can come
back into the center of the chest and
then release right if it comes down
shake out the standing leg and find your
way to the other side right foot so the
left foot so if balance is an issue for
you the big toe can stay on the mat you
can just kind of connect the sole of the
foot with the ankle and this will give
you a little bit more stability you can
also hold on to a wall know that
everyday your balance is different and
it's really just our ability to come
back into the shape with compassion so
if you're feeling a bit competitive or
hard on yourself as you sway your body
as your body sweats as your body moves
and struggles just coming back and just
Center finding your breath not taking it
too seriously I'm saying come up if you
wish gaze can go down forward or up take
one more breath in exhale collecting
hands at heart center
and then releasing both feet and then
shaking them out i'ma stay facing you
but your feet are gonna come as wide as
your mat so that's a good marker for you
heels are gonna come in and toes are
gonna come out slightly I'm gonna bend
all the way down into my loss and a
squat pose so if your hips are really
tight here sitting up on a block is
gonna elevate you and create less
pressure on the hip joints otherwise
we're getting nice and low palms are
gonna come together and elbows are gonna
just gently press the knees back so one
I'm here especially if I'm looking to
ground I only want to take everything
sort of more internal so I'm gonna take
my thumbs to Third Eye Center so just
between the brows I'm gonna actually
drop my head into my hands creating just
a gentle rounding to the upper back and
I like to find just a little bit of sway
here just to keep the hips nice and warm
and you carry your head around all day
so this is just a nice weight just to
release opening up the back of the neck
take one more breath in and as we exhale
you gonna drop the hands you're gonna
lower your sit bones to the floor I know
you extend both legs out in front of you
so this is paschimottanasana you're
gonna flex the feet again sitting up on
a block if you need a little bit of help
you'll know you need that help if the
lower back is rounded when the legs are
straight so sitting up on a block is
just gonna create a little bit more
space through the low back you know just
take the hands beside the knees and
you're gonna walk any amount forward so
wherever you stop is perfect you're
gonna drop the chin in towards the chest
and just rest here and I like to close
the eyes just to get a little bit more
connected to my own breathing you can
really identifying the places in your
body where you're feeling the most
resistance or tightness and that's
really where you want to send the breath
just gentle inhales and fuller exhale
settling the upper body so the lower
body can lengthen out

taking one more breath in and full
exhale breath out when your anyhow we're
slowly gonna roll ourselves all the way
up
you're gonna scoot your hips forward and
you're gonna come to lie all the way
down on to your back on your back it's
just the right knee into your chest the
left leg long I'm gonna take the right
arm open and with the left hand I'm
gonna pull the right knee across your
chest into a twist now if your lower
back is feeling sensitive or vulnerable
here suggest bending both of your knees
and that's gonna loosen the intensity
through your lower back the gaze can go
up towards the ceiling or just gently
over towards the right hand and then

we'll change sides engage the core first
above all else look forward taking the
knees up dropping the right leg down so
right legs coming down left knee is
drawing into your chest and this the
same thing twist goes the other side
left hand is gonna open up this knee is
gonna take you all the way across you
can bend both knees if that feels too
intense and this is your last posture of
his practice so just really letting your
body fall a little bit heavier relaxing
through your breath then coming back

through Center hugging both of your
knees into your chest if you have time I
suggest lying yourself out into
shavasana so the heels are heavy nice
and wide palms facing up if you do not
have a moment to lie down that's fine
we'll come up to seated wherever you are
closing your eyes

checking back in with your body with
your heart with your head even though
it's a short practice the yoga has this
way of sort of sewing those places back
together so you're feeling much more of
a centered calming outlook towards those
three places a little bit more aligned a
little bit more at ease and as I said if

you have the time stay lying down you're
seated taking the hands into the heart
dropping chin into the chest and
together taking in your last breath last

exhale of the practice have a beautiful

rest of your morning afternoon or
evening thank you so much for joining me
in this practice namaste
